[<h2>Labor Mobility, Firm Monopsony, and Entrepreneurship: Evidence from Immigration Wait-Lines</h2>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fu4fq30kia4t7cy/1_JMP_Gupta.pdf?dl=0)

This paper examines how US immigration-induced labor mobility frictions affect firm monopsony power and entrepreneurship. I exploit a natural experiment in the US immigration system that unexpectedly increased Green Card (GC) related job-switching frictions for Indian and Chinese immigrants in October 2005. Using matched employee-employer data from LinkedIn, I confirm that this shock reduced inter-firm employee mobility for Indian and Chinese employees. I rule out other explanations such as changes in employee composition, selection effects, or concurrent changes in India or China driving my results. This sudden decrease in labor mobility increased incumbent firm value, with $28.7 billion in abnormal stock returns for firms with Indian and Chinese employees in the ten days following the announcement. The slowdown of internal promotions for Indian and Chinese employees suggests monopsony power as the primary channel increasing firm value. The shock to immigrant mobility also had an adverse impact on entrepreneurship. Immigration related mobility restrictions disproportionately lowered the propensity of Indian and Chinese employees to join startups compared to incumbent firms. This distortion in labor supply to startups reduced new firm formation, with 12,000 fewer new startups in markets with more Indian and Chinese employees. The distortion also decreased the funding and IPO of existing startups that had Indian and Chinese co-founders. These results reinforce the differential impact of labor mobility on incumbents and startups, suggesting that declining job-to-job transitions may help explain the slowing business dynamism in the US.
