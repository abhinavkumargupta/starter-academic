[<h2>Labor Mobility, Firm Monopsony, and Entrepreneurship: Evidence from Immigration Wait-Lines</h2>](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9694nsuhdi8o0p/1_JMP_Gupta.pdf?dl=0)

<p style="font-size:0.75em">
This paper examines how US immigration-induced labor mobility frictions affect firm monopsony power and entrepreneurship. I exploit a natural experiment in the US immigration process that increased job-switching frictions by unexpectedly introducing Green Card (GC) wait-lines for Indian and Chinese immigrants. Using matched employee-employer data from LinkedIn, I confirm that this shock reduced inter-firm employee mobility for the treated group and rule out other explanations such as changes in employee composition, selection effects, or confounding variables driving my results. The sudden decrease in labor mobility resulted in $9.3 billion abnormal stock returns for firms with treated employees. The slowdown of within-firm promotions for treated employees suggests monopsony power as the primary channel behind the increased firm value. However, these increases come at the cost of entrepreneurship, with restrictions reducing skilled labor availability to startups resulting in losses of $31.4 billion from depressed startup formation in markets with treated workers. Distortions to startup labor supply also lowered the funding and IPO of existing startups with treated co-founders. These results reinforce the differential impact of labor mobility on incumbents and startups and suggest that declining job-to-job transitions may help explain the slowing business dynamism in the US.
